## Exercise 1: Setting Up and Collaborating on GitHub üåê

**Objective**: Get a hands-on introduction to various GitHub features such as profile customization, forking, and pull requests. By the end of this exercise, you'll have a personalized GitHub profile, a forked repository, and experience collaborating on a project.

### Instructions:

1. **Craft Your GitHub Identity**: 
   - Visit the [GitHub guide](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/customizing-your-profile/managing-your-profile-readme).
   - Create a `README.md` to personalize your profile.

2. **Make Your Copy**: 
   - Navigate to the [forking instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo#forking-a-repository).
   - Fork our [project repository](https://github.com/grundkurs-git/.github), creating your personal copy
      - Use "grundkurs-git" as name

3. **Roster Update**:
   - Within your forked repository, find the **Participants HS23** list.
   - Add a link to your GitHub profile.

The list is located under `profile/README.md`

4. **Become a Contributor**:
   - Once your profile link is added in your local copy, initiate a Pull Request to propose your updates to the [course project](https://github.com/grundkurs-git/.github).
      - To initiate a pull request, locate the "Contribute" dropdown (often found towards the upper right).
      - Click on "Contribute" and select "Open pull request".
      - Ensure you're proposing changes from your branch/fork to the main branch of the [course project](https://github.com/grundkurs-git/.github).
      - Submit your pull request with a succinct, descriptive message detailing your proposed alterations.

### Reflection:

1. How does a personalized `README.md` benefit your GitHub profile?
2. Describe the significance of forking in collaborative projects.
3. What is the purpose of a Pull Request and how does it facilitate collaboration?

Give yourself a pat on the back! üåü These foundational steps are your gateway to a world of collaborative coding and open-source contributions. Keep up the momentum!
